# Text Analysis with Python for Absolute Beginners

## Day 1 (November 16)

This lesson introduces text analysis for humanities, as well as introduces the [Constellate platform](https://constellate.org/) and it's corpus builder. Slides are available [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE7EIKQJdg/gguhvldVcyNIMNl--nPxbw/view#8).

This lesson introduces [Jupyter Notebooks](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms#:~:text=Jupyter%20notebook%20(file)), then dives into basic Python [operators](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator), [expressions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression), data types, [variables](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#variable), and basic [functions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function). After that, we will try our hand at text analysis by finding [significant terms](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms#:~:text=Tagging%2C%20Lemmatization%2C%20Tokenization.-,Term%20Frequency,-%2DInverse%20Document%20Frequency) in our previously assembled datasets.
