    "## Why are we using Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "There are two reasons we are using notebooks for this workshop:\n",
    "1. **They allow you to write code immediately.**<br/> A notebook is like a virtual computer that is ready for you to write and run code in immediately. This means you can start coding without having to install the programming language (in our case Python) or a program to write the language in (an \"Integrated Development Environment\" or \"IDE\" such as Visual Studio) on your own computer.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "2. **They look prettier than raw code.** <br/> Jupyter Notebooks combine text, images, and code so that the document you are working in looks more like a website than raw code. This makes the code easier to annotate and to follow and learn from. Here is a comparison of the same code and comments in a Jupyter Notebook and in raw code:\n",
